We are excited to be one of the featured open source projects in this month’s [DigitalOcean & GitHub Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!

### What’s Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long event sponsored by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub, encouraging people to contribute to GitHub-hosted open source projects, whether by fixing bugs, creating new features, or updating and writing documentation. Open four pull requests on any GitHub-hosted open source project(s) of your choice by October 31st and receive a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt. It’s as simple as that. Details are [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

### InfluxDB will match Hacktoberfest’s t-shirt offer and raise them a fistful of stickers!

For any developer that opens just two pull requests against [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb) or [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdb/telegraf) that are accepted during the month of October, we’ll send you an InfluxDB t-shirt and handful of stickers. This gets you halfway to a Hacktoberfest t-shirt! Claim your InfluxDB shirt and stickers by emailing contact@influxdb.com with your:

* Name
* Mailing Address
* T-Shirt Size
* T-Shirt Style (Regular or Ladies Fitted)
* GitHub ID
* PR #’s

**Happy Hacking!**
