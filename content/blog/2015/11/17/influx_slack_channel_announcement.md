With the recent blog on [contributing to InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/blog/2015/11/05/start_contributing.html), we have seen a significant increase in community pull requests!  To make sure that we are supporting the community as much as possible, we will now be active on the [#influxdb](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/influxdb/) channel on [Gopher Slack Community](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/).

## Why not create your own community slack?

The Gopher Slack community is very vibrant.  Since InfluxDB is a Go project, it makes sense to stay within that community.  It also allows developers who want to learn Go as well as contribute to projects like InfluxDB, making it the perfect ecosystem to ask questions about both Go and InfluxDB.
