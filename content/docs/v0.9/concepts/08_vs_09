title: Differences Between InfluxDB 0.8 and InfluxDB 0.9 
---

There are significant breaking changes between the 0.8.x versions of InfluxDB and the 0.9.x versions. The API, the schema, the data store, and the clustering algorithm have all been significantly altered and in imcompatible ways. The InfluxQL syntax has remained largely the same, although there are functions which exist only in one or the other version, and a few functions are implemented differently in the two versions.

This page aims to ease the transition to InfluxDB 0.9 for those more familiar with 0.8. It is not a comprehensive list of the differences, that would be prohibitively large. Less than half of the 0.8 code is retained in 0.9.0.

## Data Storage Engine

In InfluxDB 0.8 users could choose from a selection of underlying storage engines, with RocksDB, LevelDB, HyperLevelDB, and LMDB as available options. In InfluxDB 0.9 the underlying storage engine is always [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt), a copy-on-write B+tree.

## Write Protocols

In InfluxDB 0.8 the primary write method is a JSON protocol. In InfluxDB 0.9 the JSON write protocol is deprecated and replaced by the [line](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/write_protocols/line.html) [protocol](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/write_protocols/write_syntax.html). 

The JSON write protocol was deprecated because JSON marshalling, unmarshalling, and parsing was consuming well over half of the total CPU used to process writes. 

## API Endpoints

InfluxDB 0.8 has multiple endpoints for the API, often encoding concepts such as the database and shard space in the HTTP endpoint. InfluxDB 0.9 simplifies the common API interactions, using a common endpoint `/query` for all queries, and `/write` for all writes, regardless of database or retention policy. The database and retention policy are passed as query string parameters in InfluxDB 0.9. 

This makes the API easier to incorporate into libraries and other code, as it does not require any knowledge of the data structure to make valid calls to the API endpoints.

## Command Line Interface

InfluxDB 0.9 introduces a command line interface (CLI) making it even easier to interact with the database. Rather than rely on the Admin UI or manually crafting HTTP requests, InfuxDB 0.9 users can send writes and queries in a pseudo-interactive shell, with query output available in muliple formats, including JSON, CSV, and columnar.

The CLI does not interact directly with the influxd process, it is a wrapper around the Go client and uses the same HTTP API as any other client or library. 


measurement + tagset in 0.9 is like series name in 0.8, so metadata moved from identifier to multiple identifiers.

CLI
admin GUI simplified in favor of HTTP API administration
clustering redone entirely (CP + AP for metastore + data)
InfluxQL re-written
performance different
CQs re-implemented
