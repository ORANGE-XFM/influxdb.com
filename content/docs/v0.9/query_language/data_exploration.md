InfluxQL is an SQL-like query language for interacting with data in InfluxDB. The following sections cover useful query syntax for exploring your data.

The basics:

* [Select a database to query](../query_language/data_exploration.html#select-a-database-to-query)
* [The `SELECT` statement and the `WHERE` clause](../query_language/data_exploration.html#the-select-statement-and-the-where-clause)

The examples below query data using [InfluxDB's Command Line Interface (CLI)](../introduction/getting_started.html). For how to directly query data with the HTTP API, see the [Querying Data](../guides/querying_data.html) guide.

#### Sample data
<br>
This document uses publicly available data from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services](http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Water+Levels). The data include water levels (ft) collected every six seconds at two stations (Santa Monica, CA (ID 9410840) and Coyote Creek, CA (ID 9414575)) over the period from August 18, 2015 through September 18, 2015.

A subsample of the data in InfluxDB: 
```
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			               location	     status!				                 water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.064
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  7.887
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.028
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  7.762
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  7.635
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.041
```

The [series](../concepts/glossary.html#series) are made up of the [measurement](../concepts/glossary.html#measurement) `h2o_feet` and the [tag key](../concepts/glossary.html#tag-key) `location` with the [tag values](../concepts/glossary.html#tag-value) `santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`. There are two [fields](../concepts/glossary.html#field): `water_level` which stores floats and `status!` which stores strings. All of the data are in the database `water`.

> **Disclaimer:** `status!` isn't part of the original NOAA data - we snuck it in there for the sake of having a field key with a special character and string [field values](../concepts/glossary.html#field-value) üòè.

## Select a database to query
Select the database that you want to work with by entering:
```sql
USE <database_name>
```
CLI example:
```sh
> USE water
Using database water
```
## The SELECT statement and the `WHERE` clause
InfluxQL's `SELECT` statement follows the form of an SQL `SELECT` statement where `WHERE` is optional:
```sql
SELECT <stuff> FROM <measurement_name> WHERE <some_conditions>
```  

### The basic `SELECT` statement
---
The following three examples return everything from the measurement `h2o_feet` (see the CLI return at the end of this section). While they all return the same result, they get to that result in slightly different ways and serve to introduce some of the specifics of the `SELECT` syntax: 
 
 Select everything from `h2o_feet` with `*`:
 ```sql
 > SELECT * FROM h2o_feet
 ```  
 Select everything from `h2o_feet` by specifying each tag key and field key:
 ```sql
 > SELECT location,"status!",water_level FROM h2o_feet
 ```  

* Separate multiple fields and tags of interest with a comma. Note that you must specify at least one field in the `SELECT` statement.

* Leave identifiers unquoted unless they start with a digit, contain characters other than `[A-z,0-9,_]`, or if they are an [InfluxQL keyword](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/influxql/INFLUXQL.md#keywords) - then you need to double quote them. Identifiers are database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field keys.

 Select everything from `h2o_feet` by fully qualifying the measurement:
 ```sql
 > SELECT * FROM water."default".h2o_feet
 ``` 
* Fully qualify a measurement if you wish to query data from a different database or from a retention policy other than the default [retention policy](../concepts/glossary.html#retention-policy). A fully qualified measurement takes the following form:  
```
<database>."<retention policy>".<measurement>
 ```
 
The CLI return for all three queries:
 ```
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			               location	     status!				                 water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.064
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 coyote_creek	 between six and nine feet	  8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 santa_monica	 below three feet		          2.116
[...]
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z	 santa_monica	 between three and six feet	 5.013
2015-09-18T21:30:00Z	 santa_monica	 between three and six feet	 5.01
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	 santa_monica	 between three and six feet	 5.066
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	 santa_monica	 between three and six feet	 4.938
```

### The `SELECT` statement and arithmetic
---
Perform basic arithmetic operations on fields that store floats and integers.

Add two to the field `water_level`:
```sql
> SELECT water_level + 2 FROM h2o_feet
```
CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	4.064
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	10.12
[...]
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	7.066
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	6.938
```

Another example that works:
```sql
> SELECT (water_level * 2) + 4 from h2o_feet
```
CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.128
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	20.24
[...]
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	14.132
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	13.876
```

> **Note:** When performing arithmetic on fields that store integers be aware that InfluxDB casts those integers to floats. 

### The `WHERE` clause
---
Use a `WHERE` clause to filter your data based on tags, time ranges, and/or field values. 

**Tags**  
Return data where the tag key `location` has the tag value `santa_monica`:  
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'santa_monica'
```
* Always single quote tag values in queries - they are strings. Note that double quotes do not work when specifying tag values and can cause queries to silently fail.   
* Tags are indexed so queries on tag keys or tag values are highly performant. 

Return data where the tag key `location` has no tag value (more on regular expressions [later](../query_language/data_exploration.html#regular-expressions-in-queries)):
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE location !~ /.*/
```

Return data where the tag key `location` has a value:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE location =~ /.*/
```
**Time ranges**  
Return data from the past seven days:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > now() - 7d
```
* `now()` is the Unix time of the server at the time the query is executed on that server. For more on `now()` and other ways to specify time in queries, see [time syntax in queries](../query_language/data_exploration.html#time-syntax-in-queries).

**Field values**  
Return data where the tag key `location` has the tag value `coyote_creek` and the field `water_level` is greater than 8 feet:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'coyote_creek' AND  water_level > 8
```
Return data where the tag key `location` has the tag value `santa_monica` and the field `status!` equals `'below three feet'`:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'santa_monica' AND "status!" = 'below three feet'
```
* Always single quote field values that are strings. Note that double quotes do not work when specifying string field values and can cause queries to silently fail.
* Fields are not indexed so queries on field keys or field values are not performant. 

More on the `WHERE` clause in InfluxQL:

* The `WHERE` clause supports comparisons against regular expressions, strings, booleans, floats, integers, and time. 
* Chain logic together using `AND`  and `OR`, and separate using `(` and `)`.
* Acceptable comparators include:  
`=` equal to  
`<>` not equal to  
`>` greater than  
`<` less than  
`=~` matches against  
`!~` doesn't match against  

## The GROUP BY clause

Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group data by tags and/or time intervals. To successfully implement `GROUP BY`,  append the`GROUP BY` clause to a `SELECT` statement and pair the `SELECT` statement with one of InfluxQL's [functions](../query_language/functions.html).

### The basic `GROUP BY` clause
---
**GROUP BY tag values**  
Calculate the [`MEAN()`](../query_language/functions.html#mean) `water_level` for the different tag values of `location`:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet GROUP BY location
```
CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			mean
----			----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	5.359342451341403

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			mean
----			----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	3.5308634700810053
```
>**Note:** In InfluxDB, [epoch 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) is often used as a null timestamp equivalent. If you request a query that has no timestamp to return, such as an aggregation function with an unbounded time range, InfluxDB returns epoch 0 as the timestamp.

**GROUP BY time intervals**  
[`COUNT()`](../query_language/functions.html#count) the number of `water_level` points between August 18, 2015 at midnight and September 18 at 5:00pm at two day intervals:
```sql
> SELECT COUNT(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T17:00:00Z' AND location='coyote_creek' GROUP BY time(2d)
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			               count
2015-08-17T00:00:00Z	 240
2015-08-19T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-21T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-23T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-25T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-27T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-29T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-31T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-04T00:00:00Z	 479
2015-09-06T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-08T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-10T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-14T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-16T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-09-18T00:00:00Z	 165
```

Notice that each timestamp represents a two day interval and that the value in the `count` field is the number of `water_level` points that occurred in that two day interval. You could get the same results by querying the data 17 times - that is, one `COUNT()` query for every two days between August 18, 2015 at midnight and September 18 at 5:00pm - but that could take a while. 


Other things to note about `GROUP BY time()`:

* InfluxQL requires a `WHERE` clause if you're using `GROUP BY` with `time()`. Note that unless you specify a different upper and lower bound for the time range, `GROUP BY` uses `epoch 0` as the lower bound and `now()` as the upper bound for the query - this can lead to [unexpected results](../troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues.html#getting-unexpected-results-with-group-by-time).
* Valid time intervals for `time()` are:  
<br>
    `u` microseconds  
    `s` seconds  
    `m` minutes  
    `h` hours  
    `d` days  
    `w` weeks   

**GROUP BY tag values and a time interval**  
Calculate the average `water_level` for the different tag values of `location` in the last two weeks at 6 hour intervals:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > now() - 2w GROUP BY location,time(6h)
```
* Separate multiple `GROUP BY` arguments with a comma.

### The `GROUP BY` clause and `AS`
---
By default, queries with a function output a column that has the same name as that function (for example `COUNT()` outputs a column called `count`). If you'd like a more meaningful column name, change the name of the output column with an `AS` clause.

Name the output column `dream_name`:  
```sql
SELECT MEAN(water_level) AS dream_name FROM h2o_feet WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-19' GROUP BY time(12h)
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			               dream_name
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 4.572858333333335
2015-08-18T12:00:00Z	 4.137045833333333
2015-08-19T00:00:00Z	 4.383933333333334
[...]
2015-09-17T12:00:00Z	 4.9480999999999975
2015-09-18T00:00:00Z	 4.151916666666666
2015-09-18T12:00:00Z	 4.736755244755244
```

### The `GROUP BY` clause and `fill()`
---
By default, a `GROUP BY` interval with no data has `null` as its value in the output column. Use `fill()` to change the value reported for intervals that have no data. `fill()` options include:

* Any numerical value
* `null` - exhibits the same behavior as the default
* `previous` - reports the value of the previous window
* `none` - suppresses timestamps and values where the value is null

Follow the ‚ú® in the examples below to see what `fill()` can do.

**GROUP BY without fill()**
```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-24' GROUP BY time(10d)
```
CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			mean
2015-08-13T00:00:00Z	4.306212083333333
2015-08-23T00:00:00Z	4.328549999999998
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z	4.44695286757038
2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	4.701986209010117
‚ú®2015-09-22T00:00:00Z
```
**GROUP BY with fill()**  
Use `fill()` with `-100`:  
```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-24' GROUP BY time(10d) fill(-100)
```
CLI return:  
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			mean
2015-08-13T00:00:00Z	4.306212083333323
2015-08-23T00:00:00Z	4.328549999999999
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z	4.4469528675703796
2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	4.701986209010117
‚ú®2015-09-22T00:00:00Z	-100
```
Use `fill()` with `none`:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-24' GROUP BY time(10d) fill(none)
```
CLI return:  
```
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			mean
2015-08-13T00:00:00Z	4.306212083333333
2015-08-23T00:00:00Z	4.32855
2015-09-02T00:00:00Z	4.4469528675703796
2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	4.701986209010117
‚ú®
```

> **Note:** If you're `GROUP(ing) BY` several things (for example, both tags and a time interval) `fill()` must go at the end of the `GROUP BY` clause.

## Limit query returns with LIMIT and SLIMIT
InfluxQL supports two different clauses to limit your query results. Currently, they are mutually exclusive so you may use one or the other, but not both in the same query.

### Limit the number of results returned per series with `LIMIT`
---
Use `LIMIT <N>` with `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` to return the first N points from each series.

Return the three oldest points from each series associated with the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet GROUP BY location LIMIT 3
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			              water_level
----			              -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	7.887


name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			              water_level
----			              -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	2.028
```

> **Note:** If N is greater than the number of points in the series, InfluxDB returns all points in the series.

### Limit the number of series returned with `SLIMIT`
---
Use `SLIMIT <N>` with `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` to return every point from N [series](../concepts/glossary.html#series). 

Return everything from one of the series associated with the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet GROUP BY location SLIMIT 1
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			              water_level
----			              -----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	7.887
[...]
2015-09-18T16:12:00Z	3.402
2015-09-18T16:18:00Z	3.314
2015-09-18T16:24:00Z	3.235
```

> **Note:** If N is greater than the number of series associated with the specified measurement, InfluxDB returns all points from every series.

## Sort query returns with ORDER BY time DESC
By default, InfluxDB returns results in ascending time order - so the first points that are returned are the oldest points by timestamp. Use `ORDER BY time DESC` to see the newest points by timestamp.

Return the first five points from the one series **without** `ORDER BY time DESC`:  
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'santa_monica' LIMIT 5
```

CLI return:  
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	2.028
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	2.041
```

Now include  `ORDER BY time DESC`:  
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'santa_monica' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 5
```

CLI return:  
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			water_level
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	4.938
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	5.066
2015-09-18T21:30:00Z	5.01
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z	5.013
2015-09-18T21:18:00Z	5.072
```

Finally, use `GROUP BY` with `ORDER BY time DESC` to return the last five points from each series:  
```sql
SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet GROUP BY location ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 5
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			water_level
----			-----------
2015-09-18T16:24:00Z	3.235
2015-09-18T16:18:00Z	3.314
2015-09-18T16:12:00Z	3.402
2015-09-18T16:06:00Z	3.497
2015-09-18T16:00:00Z	3.599


name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			water_level
----			-----------
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	4.938
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	5.066
2015-09-18T21:30:00Z	5.01
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z	5.013
2015-09-18T21:18:00Z	5.072
```

## Paginate query returns with OFFSET
Use `OFFSET` to paginate the results returned. For example, get the first three points written to a series:

```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'coyote_creek' LIMIT 3
```

CLI return:  
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	7.887
```

Then get the second three points from that same series:

```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'coyote_creek' LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			water_level
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	7.762
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	7.635
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z	7.5
```

## Multiple statements in queries

Separate multiple statements in a query with a semicolon. For example:
<br>
<br>
```sql
> SELECT mean(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > now() - 2w GROUP BY location,time(24h) fill(none); SELECT count(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > now() - 2w GROUP BY location,time(24h) fill(80)
```

## Merge series in queries

In InfluxDB, queries merge series automatically. 

The `water` database has two [series](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/concepts/glossary.html#series). The first series is made up of the measurement `h2o_feet` and the tag key `location` with the tag value `coyote_creek`. The second series is made of up the measurement `h2o_feet` and the tag key `location` with the tag value `santa_monica`.

The following query automatically merges those two series when it calculates the [`MEAN()`](../query_language/functions.html#mean) `water_level`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			              mean
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	4.442107025822523
```

If you only want the `MEAN()` `water_level` for the first series, specify the tag set in the `WHERE` clause:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN(water_level) FROM h2o_feet WHERE location = 'coyote_creek'
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			              mean
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	5.359342451341402
```

> **NOTE:** In InfluxDB, [epoch 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) is often used as a null timestamp equivalent. If you request a query that has no timestamp to return, such as an aggregation function with an unbounded time range, InfluxDB returns epoch 0 as the timestamp.

## Time syntax in queries  
InfluxDB is a time series database so, unsurprisingly, InfluxQL has a lot to do with specifying time ranges. If you do not specify start and end times in your query, they default to epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) and `now()`. The following sections detail how to specify different start and end times in queries.
 
### Relative time
---
`now()` is the Unix time of the server at the time the query is executed on that server. Use `now()` to calculate a timestamp relative to the server's
current timestamp. 

Query data starting an hour ago and ending `now()`:
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > now() - 1h
```

Query data that occur between epoch 0 and 1,000 days from `now()`:  
```sql
> SELECT "status!" FROM h2o_feet WHERE time < now() + 1000d
```

The other options for specifying time durations with `now()` are listed below. If you do not give a suffix, InfluxDB defaults to microseconds.  
`u` microseconds  
`s` seconds  
`m` minutes  
`h` hours  
`d` days  
`w` weeks   

### Absolute time
---
**Date time strings**  
Specify time with date time strings which have the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm`, where `mmm` are optional milliseconds. 

Query data between August 18, 2015 23:00:01.232 and September 19, 2015 00:00:00:
```sql
> SELECT water_level FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > '2015-08-18 23:00:01.232' AND time < '2015-09-19'
```

* Single quote the date time string. 
* If you only specify the date, InfluxDB sets the time to `00:00:00`.

**Epoch time**  
Specify time with timestamps in epoch time. Epoch time is the number of microseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970. Indicate the units of the timestamp at the end of the timestamp (see the section above for a list of acceptable time units).

Return all points that occur after  `2014-01-01 00:00:00`:  
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE time > 1388534400s
```

## Regular expressions in queries

Regular expressions are surrounded by `/` characters and use [Golang's regular expression syntax](http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/). Use regular expressions when selecting measurements and tags.

>**Note:** You cannot use regular expressions to specify multiple databases, retention policies, or fields.

The [sample data](../query_language/data_exploration.html#sample-data) need to be more intricate for the following sections. Assume that the database `water` now holds several measurements: `h2o_feet`, `h2o_quality`, `h2o_pH`, `average_temperature`, and `h2o_temperature`. Please note that every measurement besides `h2o_feet` contains fictional data.

### Regular expressions and selecting measurements
---
Select the oldest point from every measurement in the `water` database:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM /.*/ LIMIT 1
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: average_temperature
-------------------------
time			              degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	86            santa_monica


name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			              degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z               santa_monica		  2.064


name: h2o_pH
------------
time			              degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z               santa_monica	6


name: h2o_quality
-----------------
time			              degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z		       95	   coyote_creek


name: h2o_temperature
---------------------
time			              degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	60            coyote_creek
```

* Alternatively, `SELECT` all of the measurements in `water` by typing them out and separating each name with a comma (see below), but that could get tedious.
```sql
> SELECT * FROM average_temperature,h2o_feet,h2o_pH,h2o_quality,h2o_temperature LIMIT 1
```

Select the first three points from every measurement whose name starts with `h2o`:  
```sql
> SELECT * FROM /(?i)^h2o\.*/ LIMIT 3
```
CLI return:  
```sh
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time                 degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z               santa_monica		  2.064
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z               coyote_creek		  8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z               coyote_creek		  8.005


name: h2o_pH
------------
time                 degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z               santa_monica	6
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z               coyote_creek	7
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z               coyote_creek	8


name: h2o_quality
-----------------
time                 degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z		       94    santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z		       95    coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z		       7     coyote_creek


name: h2o_temperature
---------------------
time                 degrees	index	location	    pH	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	62            santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	60            coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	60            coyote_creek
```

* Alternatively, you could have gotten this return by specifying the retention policy `default`:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "default"./(?i)^h2o\.*/ LIMIT 3
```

Select the last 5 points from every measurement whose name contains `temperature`:

```sql
> SELECT * FROM /.*temperature.*/ LIMIT 5
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: average_temperature
-------------------------
time                 degrees	location
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	86	     santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	87	     coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	80	     coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	87	     santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	73	     coyote_creek


name: h2o_temperature
---------------------
time                 degrees	location
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	60	     coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	62	     santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	70	     santa_monica
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	60	     coyote_creek
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	60	     santa_monica
```

### Regular expressions and specifying tags
---
Use regular expressions to specify tags in the `WHERE` clause. The relevant comparators include:  
`=~` matches against  
`!~` doesn't match against

Select the oldest four points from the measurement `h2o_feet` where the value of the tag `location` does not include an `a`:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE location !~ /.*a.*/ LIMIT 4
```

CLI return:
```sh
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time                 location	    water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	coyote_creek	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	coyote_creek	8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	coyote_creek	7.887
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	coyote_creek	7.762
```

Select the oldest four points from the measurement `h2o_feet` where the value of the tag `location` includes a `y` or an `m` and `water_level` is greater than zero:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM h2o_feet WHERE (location =~ /.*y.*/ OR location =~ /.*m.*/) AND water_level > 0 LIMIT 4
```

CLI return:
```
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time                 location	    water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	santa_monica	2.064
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	coyote_creek	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	coyote_creek	8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	santa_monica	2.116
```

See [the WHERE clause](../query_language/data_exploration.html#the-where-clause) section for an example of how to return data where a tag key has a value and an example of how to return data where a tag key has no value using regular expressions.
